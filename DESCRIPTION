Description: This package performs Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses based on the core gene hypothesis for polygenic exposures.
    MR CORGE identifies a small number of putative core instruments that are more likely to affect genes with a direct biological role 
    in an exposure and obtains causal effect estimates based on these instruments, thereby reducing the risk of horizontal pleiotropy.
